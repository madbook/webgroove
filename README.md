# webgroove
hacky prototype of a simple wargroove / advance wars style game

To play, just open index.html in a browser.  Move the cursor arround with the arrow keys, and select with the spacebar.

Very little is implemented, just minimal working versions of some systems:

- movement: some terrain types have increased movement costs.  You can move through your own units, but not others'
- attack range: all units have a range of 1
- damage: all units deal damage equal to 50% of their current health.  Terrain defense bonuses not implemented.
